Calvin's Android code.

Work to be done (Still need to discuss with Android co-developers):
- Login to server to download data into mobile devices SQl database.
- Add functionality to input expenses and add them to mobile devices database.
- Add functionality to input incomes and add them to mobile devices database.
- Add functionality to input budgets and add them to mobile devices database.
- Add functionality to visualise income vs expanses vs budget or any permutation thereof, e.g. table or graph.
- Logout of server after pushing database changes to online database.
